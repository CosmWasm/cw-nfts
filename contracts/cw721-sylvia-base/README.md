# cw721-sylvia-base

This is a basic implementation of a cw721 NFT contract. It implements
the [CW721 spec](../../packages/cw721/README.md) and is designed to
be deployed as is, or imported into other contracts to easily build
cw721-compatible NFTs with custom logic. It uses the [Sylvia](https://github.com/cosmwasm/sylvia) smart contract framework for easier extension.

Use this as a base to build your own custom NFT contract.
